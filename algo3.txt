Algo 1: Given an array of numbers, find the mean, median, and mode. If you forget what they are, here's a link for definitions:

Algo 2: Given an array, sort it. There are many different sorting algorithms that you can research, but you have to be able to explain how they work if you use one.

Algo 3: Target Sum: Given an array of integers, and a target integer, you're looking to return the indexes of the two numbers that when added together hit the target sum.
  Ex: array = [1,3,10,11,14], target = 13, results in [1, 2]
  
Algo 4: Number Reversal: Write a function that takes in a set of numbers, and reverses them.
  Ex: input: 143, output: 341
  
Algo 5: Given an input string of a certain length, design an algorithm that compresses the string. The string should be compressed such that consecutive duplicates of characters are replaced with the character and followed by the number of consecutive duplicates.
  Ex: if the input string is “wwwwaaadexxxxxx”, then the function should return “w4a3dex6”.
  
Algo 6: Recursive Function: A recursive function takes an input takes in a number, and adds the previous numbers and returns a higher number.
  Ex: input: 7, output: 28 because 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 28
 
Algo 7: Given an array of objects that have 2 key/value pairs, one of which is an int, write a function that displays the total of the int key/value pair.
  Ex. let array = [
    {someKey: "someValue", someKey: 3},
    {someKey: "someOtherValue", someKey: 4}
  ]
  The answer displayed would be 7.

Algo 8: Write a heapsort sorting function. Here's a link that explains what that is: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort 
  
Bonus Algo: 
Algo 9: Rot-13 Translator: Make a quick html page that takes in an input and has a button. Use rot-13 to encrypt the string and display the new hidden string.
  Ex: input: hello class output: Uryyb pynff
  Hint: You can use codesandbox.com to make a quick React project and quickly skip the html. React has a rot-13 import that does some of the work for you.
